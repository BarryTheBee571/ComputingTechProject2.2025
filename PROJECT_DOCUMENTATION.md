#### **Ideas**
- Hangout Organiser
- App that can be used by your friend group and tracks screentime alerting everyone if someone goes over
- App that limits screen time
- An app that allows you to jot down things you see online, maybe to remember or do later. Then being able to tick them off or something
- An app that allows you to set a goal and then make increments of checkpoints that allow you track progress towards your goal
- A wellbeing app that encourage you every day, or even just a small widget application that you put on your lock/home screen that encourages you.
- An app that could update everyday with a new quick and easy recipe that is healthy and could replace you going out for fast food

#### **SWOT Analysis**
**Healthy Recipe Suggestions**

This app would deliver a fresh, quick, and healthy recipe every day, helping users avoid the temptation of fast food. Its strengths lie in promoting better eating habits, keeping users engaged with daily updates, and potentially saving money on takeout. However, it may face challenges in consistently sourcing appealing recipes and catering to diverse dietary needs. Opportunities include partnering with nutritionists or food bloggers, adding features like calorie tracking or budget filters, and monetising through premium content or sponsored ingredients. The app would need to stand out in a crowded market of recipe platforms and maintain user interest to avoid becoming just another forgotten download.

**Goal or Checkpoint App**

This app would empower users to set personal goals and break them down into manageable checkpoints, making progress feel more achievable. Its strengths include flexibility across different goal types, whether fitness, study, or finance, and a structure that encourages motivation and accountability. Weaknesses might include the complexity of designing a user-friendly interface that supports varied goals and the risk of users abandoning their plans without proper nudges. Thereâ€™s strong potential to integrate with wearable tech, calendars, or gamified features like badges and streaks. Still, it would need to compete with established productivity apps and address privacy concerns around personal data to gain trust and traction.

#### **Reflection**
Some of the ideas I had on the Impact/Effort map would be too ambitious, as well as me not knowing how to actually make most of the things. I have decided to go with the Healthy Recipe Suggestions web app as this would be relatively easy to make as all I need is to update the main page everyday with a new recipe. It does have it's flaws though, them being if the recipes not appealing to the audience, and consistently finding new recipes to upload everyday. There could also be the problem of dietary requirements that some may need and the site cannot guarantee that the recipes will fit these requirements.
