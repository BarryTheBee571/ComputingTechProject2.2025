Recipe 1- One Pot Creamy Pesto Chicken Pasta
Servings 4
Prep 5
Cook 20

Ingredients
▢1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast ($6.25)
▢2 Tbsp butter ($0.28)
▢2 cloves garlic ($0.16)
▢1/2 lb. penne pasta ($0.67)
▢1.5 cups chicken broth ($0.20)
▢1 cup milk ($0.19)
▢3 oz. cream cheese* ($0.80)
▢1/3 cup basil pesto ($0.73)
▢1/4 cup grated Parmesan ($0.44)
▢freshly cracked pepper ($0.03)
▢1 pinch crushed red pepper ($0.02)
Optional Add-Ins
▢3 cup fresh spinach ($0.90)
▢1/4 cup sliced sun dried tomatoes ($1.10)

Instructions 

Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces. Add the butter to a deep skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the chicken is slightly browned on the outside.
While the chicken is cooking, mince the garlic. Add the garlic to the skillet with the chicken and continue to sauté for one minute more.
Add the uncooked pasta and chicken broth to the skillet with the chicken and garlic. Stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the broth up to a boil.
Once the broth comes to a full boil, give the pasta a quick stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the pasta simmer over medium-low heat for about 8 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and most of the broth has been absorbed. Stir the pasta briefly every two minutes as it simmers, replacing the lid quickly each time.
Once the pasta is tender and most of the broth absorbed, add the milk, cream cheese (cut into chunks), and pesto. Stir and cook over medium heat until the cream cheese has fully melted into the sauce. Finally, add the grated Parmesan and stir until combined.
If using, add the fresh spinach and sliced sun dried tomatoes. Stir until the spinach has wilted, then remove the pasta from the heat. Top the pasta with freshly cracked pepper and a pinch of crushed red pepper, then serve.

Recipe 2- Mac and Cheese
Servings 4
Prep 5
Cook 20

Ingredients
▢8 oz. macaroni ($0.49)
▢3 Tbsp butter ($0.39)
▢3 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.06)
▢1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.03)
▢2 cups whole milk ($0.36)
▢1/2 tsp hot sauce* ($0.02)
▢1/2 tsp salt ($0.01)
▢8 oz. block sharp cheddar, shredded** ($2.24)

Instructions 
Cook the macaroni according to the package directions (boil for 7-8 minutes, or until tender). Drain the macaroni in a colander.

Place the butter, flour, and onion powder in a medium pot. Whisk and heat over medium until the butter is melted and the mixture begins to bubble. Once bubbling, continue to whisk and cook for one minute.
After cooking the butter and flour roux, whisk in the milk. Continue to cook and whisk over medium heat until the milk begins to gently simmer, at which point it will thicken to the consistency of heavy cream or gravy.
Make sure the milk has come to a simmer and fully thickened before beginning to add the cheese. If the starches in the roux have not plumped and thickened the sauce yet, the cheese will not melt in smoothly.
Turn the burner off. Season the white sauce with the salt and hot sauce.
Begin to add the shredded cheddar, one handful at a time, whisking it in until completely melted before adding more. Continue until all of the cheese has been melted into the sauce. If the sauce becomes too cold to melt the cheese, place it back over low heat only briefly to continue melting the cheese.
Do not let the cheese sauce boil. Overheating the cheese sauce can cause it to separate and become grainy, so after the milk has thickened, turn off the heat before adding the cheese.
Add the cooked and drained pasta to the pot with the cheese sauce and stir to combine. If your pasta appears to be drowning in cheese, don't worry! It'll be the perfect consistency soon as the macaroni absorbs the sauce and thickens up.
Serve hot and enjoy!
Baked Mac and Cheese
Preheat the oven to 350ºF

After combining the drained pasta and cheese sauce, transfer it to a casserole dish.
Top with more shredded cheese, then bake for 15 minutes.
To achieve a golden brown crispy cheese crust, turn on the oven’s broiler for just a few short minutes, watching it closely to prevent burning.


Recipe 3- Chicken and Rice
Servings 4
Prep 10
Cook 40

Ingredients
▢2 tsp paprika ($0.20)
▢1 tsp dried oregano ($0.10)
▢1 tsp dried thyme ($0.10)
▢1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)
▢1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.05)
▢1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
▢1/4 tsp pepper ($0.02)
▢1.25 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs (4-5 thighs) ($4.59)
▢2 Tbsp cooking oil, divided ($0.08)
▢1 yellow onion, diced ($0.32)
▢1 cup long-grain white rice (uncooked) ($0.32)
▢1.75 cups vegetable broth ($0.23)
▢1 Tbsp chopped parsley (optional garnish) ($0.10)

Instructions 
Combine the paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Coat both sides of the chicken thighs in the seasoning mix.

Add 1 Tbsp cooking oil to a deep skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, swirl to coat the surface of the skillet, then add the chicken thighs. Cook the thighs for a few minutes on each side, or until well browned. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.
Remove the browned chicken to a clean plate. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add an additional 1 Tbsp cooking oil to the skillet, then add the diced onion. Sauté the onion for about 5 minutes, or until softened. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve the browned bits from the skillet as you stir.
Add the uncooked rice to the skillet and continue to sauté for 1-2 minutes more to toast the rice.
Add the vegetable broth to the skillet and briefly stir to dissolve any remaining brown bits from the bottom of the skillet.
Return the chicken to the skillet, setting it on top of the rice. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the broth to come up to a full boil.
Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the chicken and rice continue to simmer over low, without lifting the lid or stirring, for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn off the heat and let it rest, without lifting the lid, for an additional 5 minutes.
Finally, remove the lid and fluff the rice around the chicken. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired, then serve and enjoy!

Recipe 8- chicken schnitzel
Servings 4
Prep 15
Cook 28

Ingredients
▢2 large chicken breasts (boneless, skinless (780g) $4.59*)
▢1 tsp salt (divided, $0.04)
▢1 tsp black pepper (divided, (freshly cracked) $0.16)
▢½ cup all-purpose flour (80g, $0.09)
▢2 eggs ($0.50)
▢1 Tbsp water ($0.00)
▢1 tsp garlic powder ($0.04)
▢1 tsp dried parsley ($0.05)
▢1 ¼ cup Panko breadcrumbs (100g, $0.82**)
▢½ cup Parmesan cheese (grated, (65g) $1.78)
▢2 cups vegetable oil (16oz, $1.19***)
▢1 lemon (quartered, $0.68)

Instructions 
Gather and prepare all ingredients.
Take each chicken breast and cut it evenly down the middle, lengthwise. Place each cutlet into a ziplock bag or between two sheets of plastic wrap. Then, with a meat tenderizer mallet or rolling pin, gently pound each piece to ¼-inch thickness. Season them with ½ teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of black pepper and set them aside.
Grab 3 medium bowls or shallow dishes. In the first bowl, combine the flour, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon of black pepper. In the second bowl, whisk together the egg, water, garlic powder, and parsley. In the third bowl, mix the panko and grated Parmesan.
To bread the chicken, coat each piece in flour, shake off any excess, and transfer it to the egg bowl. Coat it in the egg wash, letting any extra drip off, then transfer to the panko. Coat it in panko, pressing it to ensure the chicken is fully covered. Then place all the breaded chicken onto a sheet pan.
Once all the chicken has been breaded, heat the oil in a skillet to 350°F-375°F over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place one piece of breaded chicken into the oil. Do not overcrowd the skillet, and work in batches.

Fry the chicken undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, until golden brown. Using tongs, gently flip and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
Once the chicken is done, place it on paper towels to drain. Make sure to maintain the oil temperature at 350°F and continue frying until all the pieces are done cooking. Serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon and enjoy.
